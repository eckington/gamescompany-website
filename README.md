# Hayden Young - iMedia R085

[Live site](https://imedia-r085.netlify.com/#/)

Create a multi-page website

The project (due to CORS ruling... smh) must be run from a server. You can do this in a couple of ways.
For example, running `python -m simple-http-server` will work, as will throwing it into an XAMPP box
or anything similar. But, for convenience, I have included a Docker container (see the Dockerfile?).
You can build it with `docker build -t imedia-r085:master .`, then run it with
`docker run -d -p 5000:80 imedia-r085:master`. You can then access it on port 5000.

  internet access, web server, domain name, computer system and software)
- Prepare assets for use in web pages
- Create and maintain a test plan to test a multipage website during
  production.

Learners must be taught:
