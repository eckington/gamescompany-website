# Hayden Young - iMedia R085

Create a multi-page website

> The project (due to CORS ruling... smh) must be run from a server. You can do this in a couple of ways.
> For example, running `python -m simple-http-server` will work, as will throwing it into an XAMPP box
> or anything similar. But, for convenience, I have included a Docker container (see the Dockerfile?).
> You can build it with `docker build -t imedia-r085:master .`, then run it with
> `docker run -d -p 5000:80 imedia-r085:master`. You can then access it on port 5000.

  - Timescales
  - Resources
  - Milestones
  - Contingencies
- Create a site map with navigation links
- Produce a visualisation diagram for a web page identifying the house style
- Identify the assets needed to create a multipage website (e.g. backgrounds,
  banners, buttons, shapes, text, fonts)
- Identify the resources need to create and publish a multipage website (e.g.
  internet access, web server, domain name, computer system and software)
- Prepare assets for use in web pages
- Create and maintain a test plan to test a multipage website during
  production.

Learners must be taught:
