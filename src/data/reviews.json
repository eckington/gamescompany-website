      "It’s the little moments that really make The Division 2 pop for me.",
      "Sure, all the joy of cover-based combat is present and correct, pulling off killer flanks is compelling, and the palpable squee of excitement as a new gun drops and it’s just perfect for your loadout.",
      "Instead, I’m talking about the moments of quality that mark this out as a series contender for the best loot and shoot blaster on the market, despite a series of niggling flaws. You’ll encounter moments of beauty as you stomp through the overgrown Washington D.C., or moments so well designed you almost forget you’re in an online multiplayer RPG.",
      "For a certain type of player, i.e. fans of tactical shooters, or anyone after a more grounded feel than is offered up by stablemates Destiny and Anthem, The Division 2 also offers a solid, and mostly plausible, contemporary setting to run around in. This is paired up with cover-based combat that is frequently challenging but offers several rewarding ways to engage with enemies."
